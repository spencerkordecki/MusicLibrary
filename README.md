https://kordecki.me/music-library-demo/

## Description

A demo UI of a music library application using Vue. The album data and images are all static as this project is just meant to show off the example UI, but it is functional enough where users can search for the albums on the page to be shown a filtered list.

## Usage

After accessing the site, hover over an album to see its details and then use the search bar to filter down any data further.

## Development

### To Install Dependencies

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

### To Run

`npm run dev` builds the application in Webpack's development mode and opens the browser with webpack-dev-server running.

### To Build

`npm run build` builds the application in Webpack's production mode.
